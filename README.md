# Å - Another Programming Language
Yep, it's yet another programming language, which probably has nothing new to add.
## What's it like?
The language is heavily influenced by the C languages (and it's also written in C++).
One of the goals with the language is to introduce a more clean and, hopefully, more intuitive language.
## Why?
Because designing programming languages is a fun and learnful experience.
## How does it work?
Currently the language is parsed from a string into a parse tree, which is then compiled into Å's bytecode system (Using bytes to represent operations and arguments in a simple format).
That code can then be executed by the AAVM, taking the bytecode as input.
## State of the language
Currently, the language can only parse arithmetic expressions.
